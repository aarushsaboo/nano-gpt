# 🚀 Build Your First Transformer: Complete Learning Plan

## 🎯 What You'll Build
A **minimal GPT-style transformer** that can:
- Learn to generate Shakespeare-like text
- Run entirely on your CPU (no expensive resources needed)
- Teach you every component from scratch

## 🛠️ Refined Stack (100% Free)
| Component | Tool | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| **Language** | Python 3.8+ | Standard |
| **Deep Learning** | PyTorch | Best for learning internals |
| **Data** | TinyShakespeare | Small (100KB), interesting |
| **Development** | Jupyter/VS Code | Interactive learning |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib | Plot training curves |

## 🗺️ Learning Path (7 Steps)

### Step 1: Environment Setup (Day 1)
**Goal**: Get everything running
- Install Python, PyTorch, basic packages
- Download TinyShakespeare dataset
- Test basic tensor operations

**Deliverable**: "Hello PyTorch" working

### Step 2: Data Pipeline (Day 1-2)  
**Goal**: Understand how text becomes numbers
- Build character-level tokenizer
- Create train/validation splits
- Implement batching logic

**Key Learning**: How raw text → model input tensors

### Step 3: Core Architecture (Day 2-4)
**Goal**: Build transformer components piece by piece
- Embedding layers (token + position)
- Self-attention mechanism (the magic!)
- Feed-forward networks
- Layer normalization & residuals

**Key Learning**: How attention works, why transformers are powerful

### Step 4: Complete Model (Day 4-5)
**Goal**: Assemble full transformer
- Multi-head attention blocks
- Stack multiple layers
- Output projection to vocabulary

**Key Learning**: How components work together

### Step 5: Training Infrastructure (Day 5-6)
**Goal**: Make the model learn
- Loss function (cross-entropy)
- Optimizer setup (AdamW)
- Training/validation loops
- Basic monitoring

**Key Learning**: How models actually learn from data

### Step 6: Training & Debugging (Day 6-8)
**Goal**: Train your first model
- Start training on TinyShakespeare
- Monitor loss curves
- Debug common issues
- Save/load checkpoints

**Key Learning**: What training actually looks like

### Step 7: Text Generation (Day 8-9)
**Goal**: Make your model generate text!
- Implement sampling strategies
- Generate Shakespeare-like text
- Experiment with different settings

**Key Learning**: How to use trained models

## 🔬 Key Learning Moments You'll Have

1. **"Aha! Attention"**: When you see how self-attention lets words "talk" to each other
2. **"Training is Working!"**: When loss starts dropping and text improves
3. **"It's Actually Learning!"**: When your model generates semi-coherent Shakespeare
4. **"I Built This!"**: When you realize you understand every line of code

## 📊 Expected Results
After 1-2 weeks, your model will generate text like:

**Input**: "To be or not to"
**Output**: "To be or not to be that is the question of the heart"

Not perfect, but clearly learned patterns!

## 🎛️ Hyperparameters (CPU-Friendly)
```python
# Small but functional model
vocab_size = 65          # Character-level
d_model = 128           # Small embedding dimension  
n_heads = 4             # Multi-head attention
n_layers = 4            # Transformer blocks
max_seq_len = 256       # Context window
batch_size = 8          # CPU-friendly
learning_rate = 3e-4    # Standard Adam rate
```
